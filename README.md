# Advanced Navigation Driver for ROS2
ROS2 Driver for the range of INS systems from Advanced Navigation

Packet to Published Message Example

Copyright 2017, Advanced Navigation

This is an example using the Advanced Navigation Spatial SDK to create a ROS2 driver that reads and decodes the anpp packets (in this case packet #20 and packet #27) and publishes the information as ROS topics / messages. 

It should work on all Advanced Navigation INS devices.

This example has been developed and tested using Ubuntu Linux v20.04 LTS and ROS2 Foxy.
